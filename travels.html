            This is one of my favorite pictures I have taken of one of my favorite places!
            <br>
            <br>
            In Summer 2019, my family and I did a big Northeast and Canada vacation! One of the spots we saw was Niagara Falls.
            This photo is from the Canadian side of the Falls, which has a much better view than the American side.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our Summer vacation this year was one of my favorites ever. I would highly reccommend seeing Niagara Falls if you ever have the chance!
