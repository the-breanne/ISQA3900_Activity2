<h1>The “About Breanne Beutler” Website</h1>

<h3>Intro</h3>
This website is about Breanne Beutler. The website has three sections to discuss Breanne, her favorite travels, and her college experience. This website has three HTML pages and one CSS page. Each page has a corresponding photo to go along with the text.

<h3>Design</h3>
For this website, I wanted to follow a clean, contemporary design, with a color palette that represents my personality. I love warm, summer, and floral colors. To follow a color palette that uses my favorite colors, I selected warm pinks and oranges to be used throughout the interface.
