            At UNO I am currently a Junior and I am studying IT Innovation. I love my major and the flexibility of my course selections. In the IT Innovation program, I get to choose a lot of my own courses. I love being able to make my own decisions and design my courses based on my own personal interests.

            Also at UNO, I am involved in Greek Life. I am currently serving as the chapter president for my sorority, Chi Omega. Through Chi Omega I have gotten to meet so many awesome people at school. It was really important to me to network in college, make connections, and build a community. A sorority can help anyone to acheive these goals.
