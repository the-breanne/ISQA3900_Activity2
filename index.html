            Hi! My name is Breanne Beutler and I am a Junior studying IT Innovation at UNO. 
            I am passionate about using technology to solve business problems, and am excited to expand
            my technical skills in this class. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of school, I am currently interning in Project Management. 
            I do not see myself working in Project Management post-grad, but it has been a great learning experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            On campus, I am very involved in Greek Life! Currently, I am serving as the chapter president for Chi Omega.
            Being involved on campus is very rewarding and fun, even in these weird virtual times.
            <br>

            I am an Omaha native and graduated from Millard North High School in 2018. I live at home with my parents, my younger sister, Brittney, and our spolied cat, Mimi.
            My family and I are very close. We love watching movies and shows, playing board games, and traveling.
